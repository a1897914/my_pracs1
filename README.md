#The Pokemon Battle System
Brief description The Pokémon Fight System is a program designed for Pokémon enthusiasts to play roleversus-role games. The system will allow players to select Pokémon to play against different computer Pokémon. The goal of the project is to provide a fun Pokémon Versus Pokémon game that will allow players to experience the fun of Pokémon Versus Pokémon and to become the player who defeats all opposing Pokémon to become the Pokémon Champion.

## Getting Started
Users will interact with the Pokémon Battle programme through a friendly information entry page that will prompt the player to enter their name, age and location. The player will enter numbers to select different Pokémon. The system will then alert the player to start the battle and remind the player to cast the dice to determine the order of the round. The battle system will use the dice roll to determine if the skill hits, the damage of the skill, and the damage resisted. Make sure the input is valid. For example, if a player enters a Pokémon name during a Pokémon selection session, then the system will remind the player to enter a number and have the player re-enter it. Once a player fails three times in a match, the system will remind the player that "your confidence is drained, go home and farm". Finally, after the player has passed all the levels, the system will automatically pop up the message "You have become your Pokémon Champion and have moved on to a new area”.
